# Washington Post 
## Analysis of Deceased Donor Potential
## 2018

### Contents

The Post analysis is explained in the Washington Post Deceased Donor Potential Methodology document. Results tables are included in the document. Responses from organ procurement organizations are appended at the end of the document. Copies of results tables and expanded year-by-year results are included here in csv format. The separate appendices have tables from the UNOS Deceased Donor Potential Study that are not publicly published. The tables have ICD-10 codes necessary for identifying causes of death that would exclude someone from being a potential donor, or indicate a likely donor. The full UNOS DDPS and other studies are linked in the Post methodology document.
